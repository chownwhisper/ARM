Perfect — that actually explains *a lot* about why they’re asking you technical questions like **SSL**, **DNS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Ubuntu troubleshooting** 👏

If your **ARM (Account Relationship Manager)** position sits **between the NOC (Network Operations Center)** and **DevOps**, you’re not just managing clients — you’re also acting as a **bridge between business and technical operations**.

Let’s break down exactly what that means and what skills you should sharpen 👇

---

## 🧭 **Your Role in the Middle: ARM ↔️ NOC ↔️ DevOps**

### 🧩 1. **You → NOC (Network Operations Center)**

* The NOC monitors uptime, network connectivity, SSL certificates, and DNS issues.
* You’ll likely **receive alerts or client complaints** (“Site is down”, “Can’t access sportsbook”).
* You need to **understand what NOC is talking about** and **translate it to clients clearly**.

**Example scenario:**

* NOC says: “The DNS A record for the client domain hasn’t propagated.”
* You explain to client: “The domain change is still updating globally — it usually takes a few hours.”

---

### ⚙️ 2. **You → DevOps**

* DevOps manages **containers**, **Kubernetes clusters**, **deployments**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.
* You may report issues like:

  * A deployment failed
  * A pod is crashing
  * API not responding

You’re not fixing it directly, but you’ll:

* Gather **relevant technical details** (logs, container status).
* Communicate the issue accurately to DevOps.
* Update clients using **clear, non-technical language**.

## 🧠 **Core Knowledge Areas for You**

Here’s a list of topics that fit *exactly* your bridge role (between NOC & DevOps):

| Area                          | Why It’s Important                   | What to Focus On                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linux / Ubuntu basics**     | Almost all servers run on it         | Commands: `top`, `df -h`, `systemctl status`, `journalctl -xe` |
| **Networking fundamentals**   | Troubleshooting connectivity         | Ping, traceroute, ports, firewalls                             |

| **SSL/TLS**                   | Secure access and certificate issues | Certificates, HTTPS, expiration checks                         |
| **Docker basics**             | DevOps-level deployment              | Images, containers, logs, restarts                             |
| **Kubernetes**                | App orchestration                    | Pods, deployments, services, logs                              |
| **Monitoring tools**          | You’ll see these alerts              | Grafana, Prometheus, Zabbix, ELK                               |
| **CI/CD concepts**            | Understand app deployments           | Pipelines, builds, rollouts, versioning                        |
| **Incident handling**         | Critical for ARM                     | Escalation paths, communication flow                           |
| **Documentation & reporting** | Keeps everyone aligned               | Writing incident reports, root cause summaries                 |

## 🧩 **What Troubleshooting You Might Do**

While you won’t perform deep engineering fixes, you’ll often do **Tier 1 or Tier 2 troubleshooting**:

| Layer           | Example Issue              | What You’d Do                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**     | Client can’t reach site    | Check DNS resolution, ping IP                   |
| **SSL**         | Browser shows “Not Secure” | Check certificate expiry, HTTPS redirect        |
| **Server**      | Website down               | Ask NOC for system status, disk usage           |
| **Application** | API errors                 | Ask DevOps to check container logs              |
| **Deployment**  | New version failed         | Confirm rollback or check Kubernetes pod status |
| **User issue**  | Admin can’t log in         | Check if backend auth service is up             |

## 🧰 **How to Excel in This Hybrid Role**

| Skill                        | How It Helps                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Technical literacy**       | Speak both “client” and “engineer” languages           |
| **Calm communication**       | Clients panic when things go down — you stay composed  |
| **Incident management**      | Coordinate between NOC & DevOps efficiently            |
| **Analytical thinking**      | Spot patterns in recurring issues                      |

Would you like me to create a **custom roadmap** (8–10 weeks) with **free resources, YouTube tutorials, and practice tasks** specifically tailored for this *ARM-between-NOC-and-DevOps* position?
It’ll help you learn exactly what you need — not too deep, but just enough to be technically fluent.
