Excellent question ‚Äî and you‚Äôre thinking exactly like someone in a **NOC/DevOps-bridge** role should üëè

Let‚Äôs go step by step and explain **what ‚Äúdifferent IPs from 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1‚Äù means**, why it happens, and how you analyze it during DNS troubleshooting.

---

## üß† First: What are 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1?

| DNS Resolver                       | Provider          | Purpose                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`               | Google Public DNS | Global, fast, often cached   |
| `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`               | Cloudflare DNS    | Privacy-focused, also global |
| `9.9.9.9`, `149.112.112.112`       | Quad9             | Security-filtered            |
| `208.67.222.222`, `208.67.220.220` | OpenDNS (Cisco)   | Enterprise filtering         |
| `94.140.14.14`, `94.140.15.15`     | AdGuard DNS       | Privacy/ad-blocking          |
| `64.6.64.6`, `64.6.65.6`           | Verisign DNS      | Stable, reliable             |

---

## üîç Why test with different DNS servers?

Because **each public resolver caches** DNS records independently.
When you change a DNS record (like an A record for your site), some resolvers update instantly ‚Äî others still serve the **old IP** until their cache expires (TTL).

That‚Äôs called **DNS propagation delay**.

---

## üß™ Test example

Let‚Äôs say your site recently changed from **203.0.113.42 ‚Üí 198.51.100.17**.

Run:

```bash
dig example.com @8.8.8.8 +short
```

**Output:**

```
198.51.100.17
```

Then:

```bash
dig example.com @1.1.1.1 +short
```

**Output:**

```
203.0.113.42
```

## üß© Interpretation

| Resolver             | IP Returned   | Meaning           |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 8.8.8.8 (Google)     | 198.51.100.17 | Updated record    |
| 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) | 203.0.113.42  | Cached old record |

‚úÖ This means your DNS update **has propagated partially** ‚Äî some servers still have stale (old) data.

---

## üß≠ What‚Äôs Happening Behind the Scenes

Each resolver keeps a **TTL (Time To Live)** for every DNS record.

Example:

```
example.com.  3600  IN  A  198.51.100.17
```

That `3600` means **1 hour** ‚Äî so each resolver will keep the old IP cached for up to 1 hour before fetching the new one from the authoritative nameserver.

If you changed DNS 10 minutes ago and still see different IPs:

* Google‚Äôs DNS might‚Äôve refreshed already
* Cloudflare‚Äôs DNS still holding old cache
* Others may update soon

Propagation time depends on:

* TTL setting
* Resolver refresh policies
* Regional cache behavior

---

## üß∞ Recommended Troubleshooting Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check all major resolvers

```bash
dig example.com @8.8.8.8 +short
dig example.com @1.1.1.1 +short
dig example.com @9.9.9.9 +short
dig example.com @208.67.222.222 +short
```

If all match ‚Üí ‚úÖ propagation complete.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check authoritative nameserver directly

This shows what your domain‚Äôs **official DNS host** is serving.

```bash
dig NS example.com +short
```

Output:

```
ns1.digitalocean.com.
ns2.digitalocean.com.
```

Then query it directly:

```bash
dig example.com @ns1.digitalocean.com +short
```

If the authoritative nameserver returns the *new IP* but public resolvers return the *old IP* ‚Üí that‚Äôs purely propagation delay.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check TTL

```bash
dig example.com +noall +answer
```

Output:

```
example.com.  3600  IN  A  198.51.100.17
```

TTL = 3600 ‚Üí you can expect full propagation within that time.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify globally with a propagation checker

Use:

* [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
* [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)

It queries dozens of DNS servers worldwide and shows which IP each location sees.

---

## üß† Analytical Insight (for ARM-level thinking)

When you notice different IPs across resolvers:

* It‚Äôs **not a failure** ‚Äî it‚Äôs **DNS behaving as designed**.
* Don‚Äôt restart services or panic ‚Äî wait for TTL expiry.
* However, if propagation takes much longer than TTL:

  * Check if zone file updated properly
  * Check registrar‚Äôs NS delegation
  * Confirm caching at CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai, etc.)

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

| Different IPs                      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial propagation    | Wait TTL or flush cache           | Monitor                         |
| No response / NXDOMAIN             | ‚ùå Misconfiguration        | Verify zone file or NS delegation | Escalate                        |
| Correct IP from authoritative only | ‚è≥ Not yet cached globally | Normal propagation delay          | Wait TTL                        |

## üß† Bonus Tip

You can flush local DNS cache too:

* macOS: `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
* Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
* Linux (systemd): `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

Would you like me to extend this with a **‚ÄúDNS propagation troubleshooting lab‚Äù** ‚Äî where I simulate step-by-step `dig` outputs (old IP vs new IP vs authoritative) so you can practice interpreting them like a real NOC engineer?
